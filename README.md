# Frontend Recruitment Task

This project is a solution to the frontend recruitment task. It is built with pure HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
bun run start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project, run:

```bash
bun run build
```

This will compile the Tailwind CSS and create the `output.css` file in the `src` directory.
